1. Authentication
 # Minimal Laravel authentication scaffolding with Blade, Vue, or React + Tailwind. #


composer require laravel/breeze

php artisan breeze:install

php artisan migrate
npm install
npm run dev

php artisan serve

2. Authorization (Roles and Permissions)
   Use Laravel's built-in authorization features to control user access to different parts of your app based on roles or permissions.

    // Define a policy or gate for user roles/permissions.
    Gate::define('admin-only', function ($user) {
        return $user->role === 'admin';
    });

    // In your controller:
    if (Gate::allows('admin-only')) {
        // Admin-specific action
    } else {
        abort(403, 'Unauthorized action.');
    }

    or more advanced package.
     composer require spatie/laravel-permission

 3. Input Validation
    Always validate user inputs to prevent malicious data from entering your application. Laravel provides a powerful validation system that you can use in your controllers or request classes.

    Example of using a form request validation in a controller:

    public function store(Request $request)
    {
        $validated = $request->validate([
            'email' => 'required|email',
            'password' => 'required|min:8',
        ]);

        // Your code to store data after validation
    }

4. SQL Injection Prevention
   Laravel's query builder and Eloquent ORM automatically protect against SQL injection attacks by using prepared statements.

   For example:
   // Safe query using Eloquent:
   $user = User::where('email', $email)->first();

   // Using query builder:
   $user = DB::table('users')->where('email', $email)->first();
   Always use parameter binding, which is built into Eloquent and Laravel's query builder to prevent SQL injection.

5. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention
   XSS occurs when an attacker injects malicious scripts into the web page.
   Laravel helps prevent XSS by automatically escaping output in Blade templates.
