1. Authentication
 # Minimal Laravel authentication scaffolding with Blade, Vue, or React + Tailwind. #


composer require laravel/breeze

php artisan breeze:install

php artisan migrate
npm install
npm run dev

php artisan serve

2. Authorization (Roles and Permissions)
   Use Laravel's built-in authorization features to control user access to different parts of your app based on roles or permissions.

    // Define a policy or gate for user roles/permissions.
    Gate::define('admin-only', function ($user) {
        return $user->role === 'admin';
    });

    // In your controller:
    if (Gate::allows('admin-only')) {
        // Admin-specific action
    } else {
        abort(403, 'Unauthorized action.');
    }

    or more advanced package.
     composer require spatie/laravel-permission

 3. Input Validation
    Always validate user inputs to prevent malicious data from entering your application. Laravel provides a powerful validation system that you can use in your controllers or request classes.

    Example of using a form request validation in a controller:

    public function store(Request $request)
    {
        $validated = $request->validate([
            'email' => 'required|email',
            'password' => 'required|min:8',
        ]);

        // Your code to store data after validation
    }

4. SQL Injection Prevention
   Laravel's query builder and Eloquent ORM automatically protect against SQL injection attacks by using prepared statements.

   For example:
   // Safe query using Eloquent:
   $user = User::where('email', $email)->first();

   // Using query builder:
   $user = DB::table('users')->where('email', $email)->first();
   Always use parameter binding, which is built into Eloquent and Laravel's query builder to prevent SQL injection.

5. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention
   XSS occurs when an attacker injects malicious scripts into the web page.
   Laravel helps prevent XSS by automatically escaping output in Blade templates.

   {{ $userInput }}


6. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection
   Laravel protects your application from CSRF attacks by generating a token for every active session.
   This token is verified with every form submission.

   <form method="POST" action="/submit">
       @csrf
       <!-- Form fields -->
       <button type="submit">Submit</button>
   </form>

    Laravel will automatically check the CSRF token when a POST request is made,
    and if it doesn't match, the request will be denied.

7. Password Hashing
   Never store plain text passwords. Use Laravel's built-in Hash facade to securely hash passwords before storing them.


   use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Hash;

   $password = Hash::make('user_password');


   When verifying passwords during login:
    if (Hash::check('user_password', $storedPassword)) {
        // Passwords match
    }

8. Rate Limiting
   To prevent brute force attacks, you can use Laravel’s rate limiting functionality.



   use Illuminate\Cache\RateLimiting\Limit;

   Route::middleware('throttle:10,1')->group(function () {
       // Limit 10 requests per minute
       Route::post('/login', [LoginController::class, 'login']);
   });

9. Encrypting Sensitive Data
   To store sensitive data securely, you can use Laravel’s built-in encryption mechanisms.

   For example, using Crypt facade:

   use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Crypt;

   $encrypted = Crypt::encryptString('Sensitive Data');
   $decrypted = Crypt::decryptString($encrypted);


10. Secure Headers
    You can set secure HTTP headers for added protection. Laravel provides a middleware to add security headers such as X-Content-Type-Options and Strict-Transport-Security.

    In your App\Http\Middleware\SecureHeaders.php:

    public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        $response = $next($request);

        $response->headers->set('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');
        $response->headers->set('Strict-Transport-Security', 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains');

        return $response;
    }

    //Register this middleware in Kernel.php.
