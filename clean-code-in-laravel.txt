Using the dependency injection, which makes the code more testable and flexible.
The Laravel service container is powerful for managing class dependencies and performing dependency injection.

Eg:

use Illuminate\Contracts\Cache\Repository as Cache;

public function __construct(Cache $cache)

{

    $this->cache = $cache;

}

public function index()

{

    $users = $this->cache->remember(â€˜usersâ€™, 60, function () {

    return User::all();

    });

}


Another example is the use of raw SQL queries instead of Eloquent ORM.
Eloquent provides a more readable, maintainable, and secure way to interact with the database.

Shifting to Eloquent ORM can significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection.
Eloquent automatically handles escaping user input, ensuring that any data passed to queries is properly sanitized.

For example, instead of writing raw SQL queries like this:
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '$email'";

Eloquent would allow you to do this:
$user = User::where('email', $email)->first();
